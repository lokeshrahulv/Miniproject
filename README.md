## Title of the Project
Credit card fraud detection using 
transaction analysis.
Credit card fraud detection is crucial for ensuring secure transactions in the financial industry, particularly with the rise of online banking. 

## About
This project aims to accurately identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing details such as transaction amounts, times, merchant IDs, and cardholder information. By incorporating credit card provider data (e.g., RuPay, Visa, MasterCard).
We can further optimize fraud detection and security. The goal is to build a system that provides real-time fraud detection, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for users.
